## 10/18/2025 12 PM - Started the project and made some 3D models  

Well what could I possibly say. Started on stage 1 of my project, which is a spinner that prepares the chips for later stages. here are some screenshots and photos of my progress!

Next up, i will print the spinner to test it out on my cardboard base

(from latest to oldest)

## 10/18/2025 3 PM - Printed the spinner and assembled the plate  

As the title suggests, I printed the spinner and assembled the base plate to test it out.

Here is my slicer's info on the print:

and here is the printed spinner (support & tower removed) on my Bambu Lab A1:

## 10/18/2025 4 PM - The spinner's pole is not centred  

NO WONDER THE SPINNER WAS SO UNSTABLE WHEN I WAS TESTING IT!!! the pole was not even centred. i have no idea what i did, but it looked like this: (pls ignore the support)

## 10/18/2025 5 PM - Printed the new spinner & reassembled and tested  

There really isn't much at all to say, but i reprinted the spinner at 40% infill, used about 6 grams of filament. Here is a screenshot of my slicer:

and here is my janky timelapse of the print, enjoy ig! (note, i didnt use the builtin timelapse because it takes too long and uses extra filament):
