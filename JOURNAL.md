## 10/18/2025 12 PM - Started the project and made some 3D models  

Well what could I possibly say. Started on stage 1 of my project, which is a spinner that prepares the chips for later stages. here are some screenshots and photos of my progress!

Next up, i will print the spinner to test it out on my cardboard base

(from latest to oldest)

## 10/18/2025 3 PM - Printed the spinner and assembled the plate  

As the title suggests, I printed the spinner and assembled the base plate to test it out.

Here is my slicer's info on the print:

and here is the printed spinner (support & tower removed) on my Bambu Lab A1:

and here is the cardboard plate, now complete (only 1 hole for now):

finally, the plate with the spinner, and some poker chips (the white one was 3d-printed):

## 10/18/2025 4 PM - The spinner's pole is not centred  

NO WONDER THE SPINNER WAS SO UNSTABLE WHEN I WAS TESTING IT!!! the pole was not even centred. i have no idea what i did, but it looked like this: (pls ignore the support)

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mjg2MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1ac5c7b9df4b70144c2974d971166fbcad7ab757/image.png)


and here is the fixed one, i will print it soon :tm:. :sob: wasted 5+ grams of precious filament...

## 10/18/2025 5 PM - Printed the new spinner & reassembled and tested  

There really isn't much at all to say, but i reprinted the spinner at 40% infill, used about 6 grams of filament. Here is a screenshot of my slicer:

and here is my janky timelapse of the print, enjoy ig! (note, i didnt use the builtin timelapse because it takes too long and uses extra filament)

## 10/25/2025 - Modified the spinner to be double instead of single  

After printing the single spinner (idk what to call it so...), i thought it would be hard to spin 100 poker chips with only a single "blade", so now i have double-blade. Maybe i should make the spinner taller??

it was really hard to make the spinner symmetrical, so i used quite a lot of time making such a simple thing  

## 10/28/2025 5:01 PM - Printed the spinner  

I just exported the model and sliced it using Bambu Studio (used 6.66g of filament). it just finished and i measured it but THE SIDES ARE NOT EQUAL!!! 2 sides are 80mm (correct), but the rest are ~84mm for some reason... time to fix it
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjEzMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--20c5c1b8a18c890006283392408cad302f317d91/image.png)
  

## 10/28/2025 5:10 PM - Quick fix   

Fixed the spinner to have uniform length (80mm) for all the sides. also made the spinner a bit stronger (more infil) so it doesnt bend so easily (yeah i almost broke it off)

![Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 5.08.27 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjEzMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d0d3e94a48812295196a7882bb13975e0e541cee/Screenshot%202025-10-28%20at%205.08.27%E2%80%AFPM.png)
  

## 10/29/2025 - Improved the spinner  

When I was halfway through the print yesterday, I realised that these were not rounded: ![Screenshot 2025-10-29 at 4.03.57 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjQzMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3345c42b869c4d36d2ce6df1c69e883928bfc4d2/Screenshot%202025-10-29%20at%204.03.57%E2%80%AFPM.png)
So i kinda wasted 3 grams of filament but anyways...

This is how the spinner looks like (7 grams according to Bambu Studio). the pink stuff are my anti-friction(tm) bumpers, and i hope they actually work
![Screenshot 2025-10-29 at 4.05.00 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjQzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e8b8504656f2fe57552974ed9145c51778e0f0c1/Screenshot%202025-10-29%20at%204.05.00%E2%80%AFPM.png)

I am currently printing the spinner, 6 minutes left!
